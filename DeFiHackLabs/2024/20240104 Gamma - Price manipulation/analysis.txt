Looks like it could be a Gamma issue, since funds came from a Gamma contract. This seems to be an exploit on Gamma’s hypervisor contract, rather than algebra itself. Still being exploited up to $3.4M.

That’s the hacker’s address:

There is constant flow to and from the hypervisor contract (gamma’s strategy manager) and some of the “attacked” algebra pools were not entirely drained.
