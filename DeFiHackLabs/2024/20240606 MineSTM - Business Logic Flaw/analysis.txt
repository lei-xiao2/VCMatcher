STM token exploited. https://app.blocksec.com/explorer/tx/bsc/0x849ed7f687cc2ebd1f7c4bed0849893e829a74f512b7f4a18aea39a3ef4d83b1…. There's "sell" function in "MineSTM" contract, and it uses reserve of pair for liquidity calculation. Hacker manipulated reserve amount by swapping large amount of tokens, and then called "sell" function to get lots of tokens.翻译帖子
